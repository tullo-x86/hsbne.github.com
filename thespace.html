    <h3>What can you find on our Campus?</h3>
    <h4>The Green Room</h4>
    <p>
    HSBNE is divided into 3 buildings. The first is considered our clean building, and its where you can find
    people working on anything from 3d printing to sewing, or maybe even combining the two. We have a large
    common area devoted as a general workspace and hangout zone, and we call this the green room.
    </p>
    <p>
    We provide most of our hand tools in this room, soldering irons, oscilloscopes, laser cutters, pcb etchers,
    hammers, screwdrivers, drills etc.
    </p>
    <h4>Co-Working Desks</h4>
    <p>
    If you want to build in your own workspace at HSBNE, there are the coworking desks. These are limited spaces
    of approx 1.5m of desk, charged on top of HSBNE membership at a scaling rate, depending on demand. If you want
    to keep your tools at HSBNE and don't want them generally available, this is a good way to go.
    </p>
    <h4>The Classroom</h4>
    <p>
    Currently under construction, the classroom is being set up to be configurable to allow members to teach
    anything. It has a capacity of around 30 people.
    </p>
    <h4>Member Storage</h4>
    <p>
    We devote an entire, locked to non-members room for members to store their tools and projects in 55L tubs.
    </p>
    <h4>The ChemLab</h4>
    <p>
    The pet project of some of our members, they're building a chemistry laboratory and one day hope to get it
    certified.
    </p>
    <h4>The Boneyard</h4>
    <p>
    HSBNE accepts donations from businesses and our members quite regularly. We store these donations in a room
    known as the boneyard. If you're a member and you need to scavenge for a switch here or a motor there, the
    Boneyard is the place to look.
    </p>
    <h4>Woodworking</h4>
    <p>
    Our woodworking focus is nascent, but as more members join and become interested in this, we have an entire
    room in the warehouse devoted to it, as well as some tools: saws, dust extractors etc.
    </p>
    <h4>Breaker Room</h4>
    <p>
    Set aside for project assembly and general use, the breaker room sits between woodworking and metalworking,
    and houses our 1ton, 1m<sup>2</sup> 3-phase Kiln.
    </p>
    <h4>Metalworking</h4>
    <p>
    Our best equipped room, metworking holds 2 lathes, a manual mill, metal bandsaw, linisher, and welding
    equipment.
    </p>
    <h4>The Warehouse</h4>
    <p>
    The warehouse is our giant, general purpose room. Configurable with 2 6x4m doors and 2 6x4m concertinas,
    The warehouse holds our 2 ton Gantry, block-and-tackle, and our full sized car grease trap. It also is
    home to our Giganto-Printer, a 5x3m poster printer being converted for a new hackerspace life.

    <h3>How to get to HSBNE</h3>
    <h4>By Car</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://goo.gl/maps/JWXMa">Ideal Driving Route</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    Make your way onto the ICB Northbound, follow through onto Kingsford Smith Drive. Take a right at Remora Rd,
    and a left at the first roundabout, onto MacArthur Ave. Continue past the first (and only) left hand turn
    (Barcham St) and turn right into our driveway just past that.
    </p>
    <h4>By Bus</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://jp.translink.com.au/travel-information/journey-planner/start-journey?to=Racecourse%20Rd%20at%20Hamilton%20Central%2C%20stop%2020">Translink Planner</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://goo.gl/maps/kHKF6">Walking Route</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    Currently the nearest bus stop to the space is Racecourse Road, this is about 1500m walk to the new space.
    If you catch a bus to Racecourse Road at Hamilton Central then from there walk south to Kingsford Smith Drive,
    Cross KSD at the lights and turn left, walk about 100m and turn right into Harbour Road. Follow Harbour road
    round past Portside shops and turn right onto Macarthur Ave at the roundabout, walk about another 900m past
    all the warehouses and the tank farm and the space will be on your right.
    </p>
    <h4>By Ferry</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://jp.translink.com.au/travel-information/journey-planner/start-journey?to=Bretts%20Wharf%20Ferry%20Terminal">Translink Planner</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://goo.gl/maps/QdWDi">Walking Route from Brett's Wharf</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://goo.gl/maps/kPHxs">Walking Route from Northshore Hamilton</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    Most of the time the best City Cat terminal to go to is Bretts Wharf, All services going downstream to
    Apollo Road stop here. It's about 1500m walk to the new space. If you catch a City Cat to Brett's Wharf
    walk up the ramp and turn right onto Kingsford Smith Drive, walk about 300m and turn right into Harbour
    Road. Follow Harbour road round past Portside shops and turn right onto Macarthur Ave at the roundabout,
    walk about another 900m past all the warehouses and the tank farm and the space will be on your right.
    </p>
    <p>
    Some services, mostly on weekends and during peak hour, go to the Northshore Hamilton City Cat terminal,
    If you happen to get off here. Walk up the ramp and through the park, turn left and walk about 600m past
    the really TALL shed and car park and the space is the first driveway on your left.
    </p>
    <h4>Walking / Riding</h4>
    <p>
    <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/MDaiB">Shortest most direct route. 7.9Km</a> This is the shortest quickest 
    way there from the city, lots of traffic, pedestrians and 99% main roads. I would only ride this if you 
    are happy riding on the road in mains road 
    traffic conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
    <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/ojf2U">Safest cycling route. 10.1Km</a> This route takes you round the back
    of the city and mostly stays to bike paths or bike lanes, it is a bit hillier but there is a lot less
    traffic to deal with.
    </p>
    <p>
    <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/NRszW">The scenic route. 15.3Km</a> This is a reasonably long and mostly 
    flat ride, there are a few hills when you come round past the story bridge including one evilly steep 
    one, but it's well worth doing. Wear plenty of sunscreen and bring water to drink as there's a few 
    gaps with little cover and no water to be found.
